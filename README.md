## <b>Delete a plugin</b>

### <b>Before starting, make sure ImageJ is not running.</b>

### 1 - In the Package Explorer, click on a file and update the repository by pressing F5. This is needed to show possible files that were created but are not being shown.

### 2 - If you delete only the plugin (inside the default package folder), when running ImageJ it will still appear in the list and can be run normally.

### 3 - To actually delete, you need to delete the following files:
- IJ/plugins/Plugins_.jar
- Plugins_/Plugins_.jar

### 4 - So, again, in the debug options, click the down arrow and select debug_config. This will build a new .jar with the remaining plugins.
